# Benchmark Results

Benchmarking provides insights into Phink's performance in real-world scenarios, in order to vizualise its efficiency
and
fuzzing ink! smart contracts. Below are the benchmark results for various smart contracts, detailing
coverage, speed, corpus size, and the potential usage of `generate-seed`.

Each contract were fuzzed for maximum a day.

| Contract Name | Coverage | Average Speed (for 1 Core) | AFL Corpus Size | `generate-seed` usage   |
|---------------|----------|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| abax_governor | 48%      | 1500 execs/sec             | 1639            | NO (no tests available) |
| Wrapped-polyx | TBD      | TBD                        | TBD             | TBD                     |
| multisig      | 91%      | 113 execs/sec              | 1524            | YES (without E2E)       |

### Explanation of terms

- **Coverage**: Represents the percentage of the code that have been executed during the fuzzing campaign. Higher
  coverage
  indicates more thorough testing (_the higher the better_).

- **Average Speed (for 1 Core)**: The number of executions per second that the fuzzer can handle on a single CPU core.
  This metric helps gauge Phink's performance efficiency. As a reminder of execution contains multiple calls, up to
  `max_messages_per_exec`.

- **AFL Corpus Size**: The size of the corpus generated by AFL++ during fuzzing. A larger
  corpus generally implies a diverse set of inputs to test the contract.

- **`generate-seed` usage**: Indicates whether `generate-seed` was used to seed the initial tests. This depends if the
  contract include tests within the contract.
