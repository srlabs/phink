# 🐙 Phink

**Phink** is a blazing-fast⚡, property-based, coverage-guided fuzzer for ink! smart contracts. It enables developers to
embed inviolable properties into their smart contract testing workflows, equipping them with automatic tools to detect
vulnerabilities and ensure contract reliability before deployment.

> ⚠️ This project is actively under development with new features and improvements being made regularly. Contributions
and feedback are welcome!

## Install

### Manual Installation
If you prefer to install Phink manually, follow these steps:

```bash
cargo install --force ziggy cargo-afl honggfuzz grcov cargo-contract --locked 
cargo afl config --build --plugins --verbose --force # don't use `--plugins` if you're on macOS
git clone https://github.com/kevin-valerio/phink
cd phink/
```

### Using Docker

Alternatively, you can use Docker to set up and run Phink without needing to manually install dependencies. Detailed
instructions are available in [**README.Docker.md**](README.Docker.md).

To build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t phink .docker/
```

## Usage

### Docker Usage

To use Phink via Docker, you can run:

```bash
docker run --rm phink
```

For instrumenting a specific contract:

```bash
docker run --rm phink instrument path/to/ink_contract
```

Refer to [**README.Docker.md**](README.Docker.md) for more detailed instructions on using Phink with Docker.

### Manual Usage

```bash
cargo run -- instrumenter path/to/ink_contract
cargo run -- fuzz /tmp/ink_fuzzed_Bb9Zp # you can get this path by reading the output of the previous command
```  

## Example

#### Creating an invariant

Below are some invariants created for the [dns](https://github.com/kevin-valerio/phink/blob/main/sample/dns/lib.rs)
contract.

  ```rust
#[cfg(feature = "phink")]
#[ink(impl)]
impl DomainNameService {
    // This invariant ensures that `domains` doesn't contain the forbidden domain that nobody should regsiter 
    #[ink(message)]
    #[cfg(feature = "phink")]
    pub fn phink_assert_hash42_cant_be_registered(&self) {
        for i in 0..self.domains.len() {
            if let Some(domain) = self.domains.get(i) {
                // Invariant triggered! We caught an invalid domain in the storage...
                assert_ne!(domain.clone().as_mut(), FORBIDDEN_DOMAIN);
            }
        }
    }

    // This invariant ensures that nobody registed the forbidden number
    #[ink(message)]
    #[cfg(feature = "phink")]
    pub fn phink_assert_dangerous_number(&self) {
        let FORBIDDEN_NUMBER = 69;
        assert_ne!(self.dangerous_number, FORBIDDEN_NUMBER);
    }
}
```

#### Catching an invariant

```bash
cargo run -- execute output/phink/crashes/<timestamp>/<id:000x:seed>  /tmp/ink_fuzzed_<random_string>/
```

Below, the trace after executing the crash:

```
🚀 Now fuzzing `/tmp/ink_fuzzed_XqUCn/target/ink/transfer.json` (5H31F11yQUkqugbgC7ur4rT2WLKSkZKAZUfcmHkKoLkaRaZ4)!

🤯 An invariant got caught! Let's dive into it

🫵  This was caused by `phink_assert_cannot_transfer_1337`
